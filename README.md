Machine Learning Model for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis
=====================================================

**Description**
---------------

This project involves developing a machine learning model for diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The goal is to create an accurate classification model that can 
predict whether a patient has Parkinson's or not based on certain features.

### Installation Instructions

To install the necessary libraries, follow these steps:

* Install `numpy` using pip: `pip install numpy`
* Install `scikit-learn` using pip: `pip install scikit-learn`

You can also install them using conda if you are using a conda environment.

```bash
conda install numpy
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
```

### Usage Examples

To use this model, simply follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset and target values into variables.
2. Standardize the data using the `standardize_data` function.
3. Train the SVM model on the standardized data.
4. Use the trained model to predict whether a new input sample has Parkinson's or not.

**Detailed Explanations of Each Section**
--------------------------------------

### 1. Standardization Function

The `standardize_data` function takes in a dataset and standardizes it using the `StandardScaler`. This standardized data is then used to train the SVM model.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing

def standardize_data(data):
    scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
    standardized_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
    return standardized_data
```

### 2. Training the Model

To train the model, simply call the `fit` method on the SVM object with the standardized data as arguments.

```python
model = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
model.fit(x_train_std, y_train)
```

### 3. Making Predictions

To make predictions using the trained model, simply call the `predict` method on the SVM object with a new input sample as an argument.

```python
input_data = # your new input data
s_data = standardize_data(input_data_np.reshape(1, -1))
pred = model.predict(s_data)
```

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use various metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.

```python
accuracy_score(y_train, x_train_pred)
precision_score(y_train, x_train_pred)
recall_score(y_train, x_train_pred)
f1_score(y_train, x_train_pred)
```
